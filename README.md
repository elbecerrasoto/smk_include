# Snakemake include keyword

## smk_include

> Flying with [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/modularization.html) _include keyword_.

> I wish to see what _include_ does on multiple _config files_.

> ... wish granted.

## Point number 2

> For larger, reusable parts that shall be integrated into a common workflow, it is recommended to write small Snakefiles and include them into a main Snakefile via the include statement. In such a setup, all rules share a common config file.
